# Shuzu
an opensource imageboard written in PHP.
___
# Set-up
To get shuzu running, you need to meet the *prerequisites*.

## Prerequisites
For shuzu to work, it needs to be in this environment:
- A PHP version that is greater than 8.0 (version's lower than 8.1 werent tested!).
- SQLite, image-magick extensions installed and enabled.
- An empty subdomain. Shuzu **can't** run in a subdirectory because of it's heavy reliance on routing.

## Installation
The easiest way to keep up with shuzu updates is to install `git` and pull to the repository every now and then.
