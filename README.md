# Shuzu
an opensource imageboard written in PHP.
___
# Set-up
To get shuzu running, you need to meet the *prerequisites*.

## Prerequisites
For shuzu to work, it needs to be in this environment:
- A PHP version that is greater than 8.0 (version's lower than 8.1 weren't tested!).
- SQLite, image-magick extensions installed and enabled.
- An empty subdomain. Shuzu **can't** run in a subdirectory because of its heavy reliance on routing.

## Installation
 - Pull the repo inside an empty directory. `git clone https://github.com/japannt/shuzu.git`
 - Follow the instructions in the section below.

### Updating?
The easiest way to keep up with shuzu updates is to use `git` and pull to the repository sporadically.

## Configuration
### Configuring shuzu:

Copy `config.default.php` to `config.php` then edit the newly copied file.

### Configuring the webserver 
Enable the general webserver file-serving, and execute php as normal.  
**Important!** Use the router `/index.php` only when the server is about to yield a 404 error!  

### Example webserver configuration(s):

Caddy:
```caddy
shuzu.example.com {
	encode gzip

	root * /srv/shuzu/

	php_fastcgi unix//run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock {
		index /index.php
	}

	file_server {
		index off
	}

	try_files {path} {path}/index.php
}
```

*PR's for the readme on configurations for other webservers will be welcome!*

### Configuring the database
Shuzu **will not** work out of the box, it needs to be configured. Thankfully it's easy to do so.
 - After configuring the webserver, navigate to `/admintool.php` and authenticate with the login and password you set up earlier.
 - Look for the `!!! NUCLEAR OPTIONS !!!` section and click the `nuke` button.
 - After the database is nuked, you can start configuring everything else.

### Adding banners
Shuzu will pick a random banner from the `images/banners/{board}` directory.
Banners have resolution of 468x80px.

To add new banners copy your banner to `image/banners/{target board}`(Create if doesn't exist).

## Good practice
It's generally a good idea to do these if you ask me.
 - Restrict the users from accessing anything in `/include`.
 - Use a strong password for the administration tool, and don't share it at all.
 - Use SSL for godâ€™s sake. (so many imageboards don't have SSL enabled.)
